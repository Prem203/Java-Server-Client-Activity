# TCP Client-Server Reverse and Case Transform Program

This project implements a TCP client-server application where the client sends a string to the server, and the server:
1. Reverses the string.
2. Inverts the capitalization of each character (lowercase becomes uppercase and vice versa).

## Features
- Dynamic port number for both client and server.
- Handles strings up to 80 characters.
- Includes string validation for length.
- Proper exception handling for both client and server.
- User-friendly error messages in case of invalid inputs.

## Steps to Run

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd tcp-client-server
